# Goal

Robust clustering for high-dimensional data represents a significant challenge, as existing robust clustering methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality when the number of variables is large, while existing approaches for high-dimensional data are, in general, not robust. We propose a solution to this challenge, by incorporating high-dimensional covariance matrix estimators into a fast and efficient algorithm for robust constrained clustering, the
TCLUST methodology, which has been extensively shown to perform well on contaminated low-dimensional data. We exploit three different covariance matrix estimators, the Minimum Regularized Covariance Determinant estimator, the linear
shrinkage estimator of Ledoit-Wolf, which is a special case of the previous one, and the
sparse CovGlasso estimator, to improve TCLUST, allowing the algorithm to effectively handle the complexity and variability of high-dimensional data, whilst being protected against the harmful effect of outliers. This thesis aims to provide a robust clustering solution that is applicable to
real-world situations, in which it may be necessary to deal with both a large number of
features and data contamination. The problem addressed in this study is the recognition
of handwritten digits, which is very challenging due to the high dimensionality of the
data, the limited separation between classes and the potential presence of outlying units.
